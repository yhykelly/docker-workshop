In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.
In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo here to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.
Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.
